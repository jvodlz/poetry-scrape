## Why a Poem Webscraper?

Words are beautiful. When you string them together you could create imagery that strikes people's emotions or help people look backwards or forwards in time.

On a whim I looked for some poems to read and after exploring [a poetry site](https://poets.org), I noticed you could filter poems by themes. This got me curious about whether poems of the same theme convey the same feelings and whether these poems share common subject(s) but was described differently by each poet.

This led me to begin Part 1 of my poetry analysis project. To achieve this, the poem webscraper was in the works.
